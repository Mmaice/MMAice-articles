Few in Iceland have heard the name **Ragnar Rökkvi Kristjánsson**, but those who have seen him train say he may be the strongest — yet most overlooked — mixed martial arts fighter in the country.

Born on **May 19, 2008**, Ragnar is only **17 years old**. Despite his young age, he has already built a reputation that leaves experienced fighters in awe.

Ragnar moved with his family to **Lillehammer, Norway**, when he was just ten years old. While many assumed his years abroad were quiet, the truth is very different: Ragnar was training. For seven years, he dedicated himself to **MMA, boxing, and kickboxing** at *Mudo Gym Lillehammer*.

Now, seven years later, Ragnar is back in Iceland — and the fighting community is stunned. Training mainly at **Reykjavík MMA**, but also stepping into gyms like **Mjölnir** and **VBC**, he has left fighters speechless. His stamina appears endless, his defense impenetrable. Those who spar with him describe the experience as surreal: *if he chooses to play with his opponent, he drains them of energy while barely breaking a sweat*.

Although still relatively unknown to the wider public, Ragnar has quietly fought in **low-profile martial arts bouts** against top-level competition — and he has never lost. Now, with plans to begin competing full-time, excitement is building. Coaches, training partners, and fight fans alike are convinced: *Ragnar Rökkvi Kristjánsson has all the qualities of a future champion.*
